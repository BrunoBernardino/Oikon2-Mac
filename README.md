## Development

Requires `node` (ideally through `nvm`) >= 10.0.0, and `npm`.

Docs: http://electron.atom.io/docs

```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
$ npm test
```

## Release

Don't forget to increment the `buildVersion` in `build.js` and update the `version` in `package.json`.

```bash
# To test the packaged app
$ npm run build
# To build a signed version to upload (crashes if not downloaded from the App Store)
$ export OSX_SIGN_IDENTITY='XXX' && npm run release
```

Make sure there's a valid `*.provisionprofile` file in the project directory (get or generate one from https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/profiles/list).

To get a list of available identities:
```bash
$ security find-identity -p codesigning -v
```

Use the "Transporter" app from Apple to verify and upload the new .pkg
